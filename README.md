ThatCloud
=========

ThatCloud is an open-source iOS application that connects all of your cloud content into the Ink ecosystem of apps. It enables you to take your content from any of 10 different storage locations and view it, interact with it with other Ink partner apps and copy it to other cloud storage locations. The full list of features is detailed in our [blog post](http://blog.inkmobility.com/post/58830177894/introducing-thatcloud-your-portal-to-your-cloud).

Ink is open sourcing  our sample apps for several reasons:
  1. Get your code to the app store 

  All of our sample apps are currently in the App store. Developers learning iOS can get their code in the app store   without having to write an entire App. They only need to send a pull request.


  2. Support other iOS Framework companies
  
  The sample apps are a place where other framework companies can integrate their product to show it off to the world, or simply a place to demonstrate integration strategies to your customers.
